<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my About Me page!

  <p>My name is Josefina Van Thienen, and I was born and raised in Argentina. However, I currently live in San Francisco, which is a city that I absolutely love.</p>
  
 <p>I have always been interested in politics and social issues, which is why I pursued a degree in Political Science. However, after working in that field for a few years, I realized that I wanted to explore other areas as well. That's when I decided to pursue an MBA, which gave me a more comprehensive understanding of business and management.</p>
  
 <p>After completing my MBA, I worked in tech sales for a while, which was a very exciting and challenging experience. However, I always felt like there was something missing, and that's when I decided to start learning how to code.</p>
  
  <p>Learning how to code has been a fascinating journey for me so far, and I'm enjoying every moment of it. It's a completely different way of thinking and problem-solving, and I'm constantly learning new things.</p>
  
 <p> In my free time, I enjoy exploring the city, trying out new restaurants, and going for long walks. I'm also a big fan of traveling, and I love exploring new cultures and meeting new people.</p>
  
  Thank you for taking the time to read my About Me page, and if you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>
